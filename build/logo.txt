IMS LOGO PLACEHOLDER
====================

This file serves as a placeholder for the company logo.
In a production environment, replace this with an actual PNG/JPEG logo file.

The logo should be:
- High resolution (at least 300 DPI)
- PNG or JPEG format
- Transparent background preferred
- Size: approximately 200x100 pixels
- File name: logo.png

For now, the PDF generation uses text-based company headers.
